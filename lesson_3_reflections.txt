    I would use my remote repository so if something would happen to my working space there would be a copy of it online that would not be     cancelled

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

    It is very relative to the  person but having git be up to date with your remote repository may become confusing. It is also easier to check on Github the commits first.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Cloning is used to copy a Github repository to a local one.
    Branches are separate routes in 1 repository containing multiple changes or modifications of the master branch.
    Forks are a way to modify/add to your personal Github profile a copy of someone elseÂ´s project while keeping the original intact on the repository it was made on.
