When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use my remote repository so if something would happen to my working space there would be a copy of it online that would not be     cancelled

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is very relative to the  person but having git be up to date with your remote repository may become confusing. It is also easier to check on Github the commits first.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Cloning is used to copy a Github repository to a local one.
    Branches are separate routes in 1 repository containing multiple changes or modifications of the master branch.
    Forks are a way to modify/add to your personal Github profile a copy of someone else´s project while keeping the original intact on the repository it was made on.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a up do date copy stored locally is great to be able to see changes made and if you have no internet access you can work on them anyway.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be very hard to collab without a platform as Github. Not much would be easier and a lot would be harder for developers. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?
